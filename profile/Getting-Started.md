# Getting Started

There are several setups you can use. The OpenStack setup is the preferred method, but requires comparatively beefy hardware.

## OpenStack

Requires:

* An AMD64 machine
* At least 16 GiB of RAM
* Two network interfaces in that machine.

1. Begin by installing the latest Ubuntu Server LTS.
2. Follow the [Single-node guided](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/single-node-guided/35765) OpenStack installation tutorial with the caveats below.
